# Gesture Controlled Robot with Autonomous Mapping Project

This is a Robotic Project for our first Electrical Engineering major Electronics Course (Linear Circuit Analysis) at Information Technology University, Lahore. 
We have choose this project after getting inspired from the work done by google i.e. Google Driverless Car, in concept of making gesture controlled steered and drive vehicles. 
Also we wanted to make autonomous robot which can fly and plot map of any area in which it is exposed to this is based on idea of disaster management to map the available paths in a disaster harmed building. In this semester scope we are going to plot map of regular enviornment using a robotic car.
